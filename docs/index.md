#### Welcome to Programming Humanity

Will we program humanity into our technology, or will our technology program us? 

We bridge the gap between technology and the humanities by providing an intellectual framework of core concepts across disparate disciplines. Beginning with data and culminating with Artificial Intelligence, you will learn how to integrate seemingly isolated technical concepts within a cohesive perspective.

Technology lies at or near the heart of nearly every major issue facing us:

- threats to individual freedom via pervasive state surveillance
- threats to democracy via social media manipulation
- social injustices from biased or inaccurate data/algorithms that influence judicial sentencing, lending, hiring and promotions
- long-term structural unemployment via automation
- the proliferation of inexpensive lethal autonomous weapons
- the Pandoraâ€™s box of increasingly cheap and accurate eugenics based in part on bioinformatics
