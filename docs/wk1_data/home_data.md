# Data

Data, especially Big Data, has been called the "new oil." This is why data, along with an intimate understanding of its forms, is the introduction to our course.

We begin by exploring how humans and computers encode data differently. Philosophers have long debated whether there is a reality beyond sensory data. How do we know what we know, and do we need data, whether sensory or numeric, for knowledge?

Next we compare how humans encode data--using perception and memory--to how computers encode data. In both cases there is "loss," but the reasons are different. With computers, we can understand how information is stored--using compression--by recourse to information theory and entropy (watch out! Information entropy is subtlety different from the entropy you may already be familiar with from physics).

There is another key idea this week--the possibility that information, rather than matter, may form the basis of all reality. While we tend to think of "data" as inert, however, information is not. We'll see how the internal structure of data can produce misleading statistical measurements with Anscombe's Quartet. The Monty Hall problem will illustrate how our fundamentally flawed our intuitions on probability can be using computer simulation.

Finally, we explore the larger picture. We can often be identified by just a few pieces of information, and some suggest that with 300 likes an algorithm can know you better than yourself. Are we data? What elements of being "you" are unquantifiable? We also consider Dataism, and whether, as Harari suggests, it's our new god. Does Dataism solve the limitations of more traditional methods of knowing? Harari makes a particularly provocative claim about fighting an "old war." What's the story he tells? Do you think he's right?

DataCamp exercises offer a more traditional way of understanding Data Science, and these courses provide foundational concepts and skills that will be re-contextualized in our Data Humanities class. This week's Data Science for Everyone introduces many terms that we'll return to in future weeks--the Internet of Things, Databases, Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics, Modeling and Forecasting, and A/B Testing are just a few. We have a whole course devoted to Machine Learning and Deep Learning--here you'll get just a brief overview.
