***“We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us” – Fr. John Culkin/Marshall McLuhan***

### Course Description

How do we think of humanity in the digital age? Can we program humanity into our technology by generating music, analyzing vast quantities of literary text, and producing great visual works of art? Or will humans be programmed through genetic engineering, predictive policing, manipulations of social media, and domestic surveillance? Are we firmly entrenched in a Posthumanist world, and is Transhumanism a future to which we should aspire? By the end of this course you will:

- Have basic skills in Python, data visualization, data wrangling, and natural language processing.
- Gain a foundational understanding of key aspects of our Age of Information from Dataism and Information Theory to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
- Relate this emerging picture to conversations about Humanism, Posthumanism, and Transhumanism.
- Understand how new computational tools both challenge and deepen traditional approaches to the Social Sciences, Humanities, and Fine Arts.
- Understand emerging ethical debates surrounding key technologies poised to transform humanity.
- Have a portfolio of project-based work demonstrating your computational skills with a final project of your choice.

### Assignments

20% Attendance and Discussion

25% Quizzes

15% Mini-projects

25% Python programming exercises (10)

15% Final Project (1)

- Moodle gradebook will be updated regularly.

### Attendance

In accordance with standard Kenyon policy, absences greater than 25% of the class will result in a failing grade.

### Quizzes

Short quizzes will test comprehension of key terms and information. Quizzes cannot be made up if you miss class, but the lowest grade will be dropped.

### Mini-Projects and Final Project

You will receive a free Datacamp account with assignments due for each class session. Assignments are graded solely on completion, but you must complete them fully (i.e. no 0’s). 

Mini Projects will be assigned on DataCamp. They are more challenging and depending on the level of difficulty, we may use class time and group work to complete them.

### Final Thoughts on Grades

This class is meant to be a fun and exploratory introduction. Students will bring different strengths and backgrounds to this interdisciplinary class, and the emphasis will be on developing these personal interests and competencies. If you do the work, you will do well.

### Responsible Employee Information

We will be studying and/or discussing a number of issues that may cause discomfort or distress. If you wish to speak with either of us about any readings, assignments or class discussions, please understand that we may be required to report information about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator.  For confidential support, you may contact the following resources: The Health and Counseling Center, Sexual Misconduct Advisors (SMAs) the College chaplains, and staff at New Directions Domestic Abuse Shelter & Rape Crisis Center.

### Statement of Academic Integrity and Disability Accommodations

At Kenyon we expect all students, at all times, to submit work that represents the highest standards of academic integrity. It is the responsibility of each student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas and words they have drawn upon (see Academic Honesty and Questions of Plagiarism in the Course Catalog). Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty. If you are uncertain about the expectations for this class, please ask for clarification. Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need academic accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me as soon as possible. Also, you are required to register for support services with the Office of Disability Services in the Olin Library, Center for Innovative Pedagogy. Please contact Erin Salva at 5453 or email salvae@kenyon.edu.
