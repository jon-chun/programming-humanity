**Networking Social Animals, Hijacking Instinctual Drives and Amplifying Cognitive Biases**  

Aristotle said “Man is by nature a social animal...Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to... is either a beast or a god. ”

Last week's study of models, game theory and the unexpected emergent properties of complex systems sets the groundwork for this week's study of social networks. We begin the week by exploring graph theory and network theory. Next we refine our model by including key aspects of human behavior--cognitive biases and the emotional aspects of decision-making.

These two pillars--a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and a more complex understanding of how humans form networks with emergent properties--forms our basis for a better understanding of how social networks function. We then apply this understanding to a few examples of real-world social networks.

Much of technology, as Tristan Harris notes in the interview below, is designed to hack our human weaknesses. Our political theories, as Harari points out in that same discussion, are based on an assumption that human behavior is rational (when it's not). Can our current political environment respond appropriately to a world in which humans are easily hacked and social networks create complex emergent systems that can amplify biases and highjack instinctual responses? What are real-world solutions for ensuring that our technology promotes our humanity, not our inhumanity?
