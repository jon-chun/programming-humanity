In earlier weeks, we set the groundwork for understanding network and graph theory, as well as rational actor and cooperative game theory. This week we consider the influence of social networks and the ways in which humans operate outside rational actor norms.

We start with a number of ideas that challenge rational actor behavior: cognitive biases, the power of emotion, and biological aspects of behavior that call into question the very notion of free will itself. 

We'll then consider techniques to capture, model and exploit human emotions and social behavioral patterns using network theory and graph theory, and we'll look at a few examples of social network analysis in TV shows: *The Song of Ice and Fire* and *Friends*. In concrete terms, our coding will develop the basics of importing more kinds of data, including flat files and JSONs/tweets. In class, we'll do a bit of a deeper dive into exploring social media networks.

All of this background leads up to our Friday discussion: are we being hacked by our technology or can we program humanity into our tools? Tristan Harris made his name arguing for a more careful relationship to our tools lest they "hack" us. Yuval Harari also worries about our "hacked" humanity, most notably because the notions of "rational" humanity inherited from the Enlightenment underpin our political theory of democracy. And this conception of what it means to be human is, alas, out of date.

This week gives us the final set of tools you'll need to complete a final project. You will complete the Intermediate Importing DataCamp module, which will allow you to work with a large variety of datasets. Be sure to have your Twitter development account ready for class this week as well. By the end of the week, you should have decided whether you will be:

1. Finding a story in data (using Tableau or Python)
2. Exploring the ethics of a current technology with detailed attention to the technology itself.
3. Finding a story in twitter/social media data

Graphing social networks, like those we explore this week, is an entire field unto itself. If you're interested in learning how to code this phenomenon, consider taking the Cultural Analytics course.
