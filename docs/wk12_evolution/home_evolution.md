If we view humans from a computational perspective, we can see living cells as information processing systems executing DNA code to create proteins within an unimaginably complex biochemical operating system. At the most fundamental level, we are built from a massively parallel computational system based upon carbon and chemistry rather than silicon and electromagnetism.

This week, we explore the computational interpretation of biology as an information processing system. We'll understand why a computational model of cellular life is orders of magnitude more complex than any computational or mathematical model we've seen so far. The information, behaviors, processing pathways and feedbacks within overlapping and interconnected systems create constantly shifting and dynamically self-modifying networks. These networks are embedded within each other, inter-operate alongside each other, and run simultaneously with different signaling at multiple scales.

We also see how the unique challenges of bioinformatics require high-performance computational and large-scale statistical methods to study genomics--one of *the* original big data applications (along with astrophysics and experimental subatomic physics). Bioinformatics and computational biology have revolutionized our understanding of genetics, medicine and life thanks in large part to rapid advances in computer science: big data, computational power and improved algorithms. 

As in other weeks, we see how rapid progress in technology is poised to challenge the very nature of humanity.  Forty years ago test tube baby technologies like IVF were new, controversial and pushed the limits of medical ethics at the time. Despite initial attempts to limit access to the procedure, today approximately 10% of all births in Denmark are born with assisted reproductive technology like IVF.

The fictional world depicted in the 1997 film Gattaca is fast becoming a reality.  For the cost of a few thousand dollars, parents can practice statistical 'soft' eugenics by fertilizing multiple eggs, testing each for desirable traits across a million SNPs, and selecting the 'best' one for implantation. How can society prevent a massive, permanent, and accelerating biological inequality tantamount to a man-made speciation event, irreversibly separating the 'haves' from the 'have nots'?

This week also raises a number of questions about genetic engineering, precision medicine, the possibility of engineering deadly viruses (bioterrorism), and the quest to end mortality. Once again computation applied to a domain (that of life itself) results in possibilities that are both promising and terrifying.

Unfortunately, Datacamp does not offer concise exercises in bioinformatics, computational biology,  or genomics in Python which would also require a fair amount of domain knowledge. Instead, we'll explore these computational domains from a higher abstraction level than usual to get both the 'big picture' as well as focus on integration points with prior topics. We continue with our hands-on exploration of data science with aruguably the most popular visualization tool--Tableau. Read instructions carefully--we cannot assign homework through Datacamp as in previous weeks.
