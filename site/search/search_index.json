Some models are useful.\" All models come with some degree of uncertainty, and the more complex the model, the greater the risks for harm as models become opaque black boxes. The most powerful State of the Art (SOTA) models have been exponentially growing in compute, data and energy requirements and increasingly accessible to only the largest corporate and government research groups. In the case of the Bestseller Code that you read for last week, there are approximately 1000 parameters in the model. Deep neural network Attention Models you saw in the form of GPT-3 and DALL-E are approaching a billion parameters. This week we start with an introduction to \"the model thinker\" with an overview of the theory of models. Next we'll look the application of models by exploring some of the most common types, namely linear models and classificatory models. We'll also consider the importance of models for understanding one of our most pressing global issues: climate change. We'll also look at why COVID-19 has been so hard to model. For Friday, we'll consider three questions for our discussion. The first concerns responses to COVID. Given the difficulty, officials have had to make public policy decisions in the face of very real uncertainty. How much of this uncertainty should be conveyed to the public? Is the noble lie necessary in order to ensure compliance with any and all recommendations? How do we treat those who publicly disagree? Next we'll consider whether math just allows us to approximate reality through models, or whether math actually reveals the underlying nature of reality. Is math our greatest invention --allowing us to predict outcomes and act in the world with agency? Or is it a discovery of the fundamental nature of reality? We'll also have a small glimpse into the issues of fairness and accuracy that can arise from complex models that use Machine Learning. As you know, we offer an entire course on Machine Learning and AI. The course is designed and sequenced to follow Programming Humanity, so please do consider continuing on the journey.

Some models are useful.\" All models come with some degree of uncertainty, and the more complex the model, the greater the risks for harm as models become opaque black boxes. The most powerful State of the Art (SOTA) models have been exponentially growing in compute, data and energy requirements and increasingly accessible to only the largest corporate and government research groups. In the case of the Bestseller Code that you read for last week, there are approximately 1000 parameters in the model. Deep neural network Attention Models you saw in the form of GPT-3 and DALL-E are approaching a billion parameters. This week we start with an introduction to \"the model thinker\" with an overview of the theory of models. Next we'll look the application of models by exploring some of the most common types, namely linear models and classificatory models. We'll also consider the importance of models for understanding one of our most pressing global issues: climate change. We'll also look at why COVID-19 has been so hard to model. For Friday, we'll consider three questions for our discussion. The first concerns responses to COVID. Given the difficulty, officials have had to make public policy decisions in the face of very real uncertainty. How much of this uncertainty should be conveyed to the public? Is the noble lie necessary in order to ensure compliance with any and all recommendations? How do we treat those who publicly disagree? Next we'll consider whether math just allows us to approximate reality through models, or whether math actually reveals the underlying nature of reality. Is math our greatest invention --allowing us to predict outcomes and act in the world with agency? Or is it a discovery of the fundamental nature of reality? We'll also have a small glimpse into the issues of fairness and accuracy that can arise from complex models that use Machine Learning. As you know, we offer an entire course on Machine Learning and AI. The course is designed and sequenced to follow Programming Humanity, so please do consider continuing on the journey.

At the most fundamental level, we are built from a massively parallel computational system based upon carbon and chemistry rather than silicon and electromagnetism. This week, we explore the computational interpretation of biology as an information processing system. We'll understand why a computational model of cellular life is orders of magnitude more complex than any computational or mathematical model we've seen so far. The information, behaviors, processing pathways and feedbacks within overlapping and interconnected systems create constantly shifting and dynamically self-modifying networks. These networks are embedded within each other, inter-operate alongside each other, and run simultaneously with different signaling at multiple scales. We also see how the unique challenges of bioinformatics require high-performance computational and large-scale statistical methods to study genomics--one of the original big data applications (along with astrophysics and experimental subatomic physics). Bioinformatics and computational biology have revolutionized our understanding of genetics, medicine and life thanks in large part to rapid advances in computer science: big data, computational power and improved algorithms. As in other weeks, we see how rapid progress in technology is poised to challenge the very nature of humanity. Forty years ago test tube baby technologies like IVF were new, controversial and pushed the limits of medical ethics at the time. Despite initial attempts to limit access to the procedure, today approximately 10% of all births in Denmark are born with assisted reproductive technology like IVF. The fictional world depicted in the 1997 film Gattaca is fast becoming a reality. For the cost of a few thousand dollars, parents can practice statistical 'soft' eugenics by fertilizing multiple eggs, testing each for desirable traits across a million SNPs, and selecting the 'best' one for implantation. How can society prevent a massive, permanent, and accelerating biological inequality tantamount to a man-made speciation event, irreversibly separating the 'haves' from the 'have nots'? This week also raises a number of questions about genetic engineering, precision medicine, the possibility of engineering deadly viruses (bioterrorism), and the quest to end mortality. Once again computation applied to a domain (that of life itself) results in possibilities that are both promising and terrifying. Unfortunately, Datacamp does not offer concise exercises in bioinformatics, computational biology, or genomics in Python which would also require a fair amount of domain knowledge. Instead, we'll explore these computational domains from a higher abstraction level than usual to get both the 'big picture' as well as focus on integration points with prior topics.

Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to... is either a beast or a god. \u201d Last week's study of models, game theory and the unexpected emergent properties of complex systems sets the groundwork for this week's study of social networks. We begin the week by exploring graph theory and network theory. Next we refine our model by including key aspects of human behavior--cognitive biases and the emotional aspects of decision-making. These two pillars--a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and a more complex understanding of how humans form networks with emergent properties--forms our basis for a better understanding of how social networks function. We then apply this understanding to a few examples of real-world social networks. Much of technology, as Tristan Harris notes in the interview below, is designed to hack our human weaknesses. Our political theories, as Harari points out in that same discussion, are based on an assumption that human behavior is rational (when it's not).

Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to... is either a beast or a god. \u201d Last week's study of models, game theory and the unexpected emergent properties of complex systems sets the groundwork for this week's study of social networks. We begin the week by exploring graph theory and network theory. Next we refine our model by including key aspects of human behavior--cognitive biases and the emotional aspects of decision-making. These two pillars--a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and a more complex understanding of how humans form networks with emergent properties--forms our basis for a better understanding of how social networks function. We then apply this understanding to a few examples of real-world social networks. Much of technology, as Tristan Harris notes in the interview below, is designed to hack our human weaknesses. Our political theories, as Harari points out in that same discussion, are based on an assumption that human behavior is rational (when it's not). Can our current political environment respond appropriately to a world in which humans are easily hacked and social networks create complex emergent systems that can amplify biases and highjack instinctual responses? What are real-world solutions for ensuring that our technology promotes our humanity, not our inhumanity?

We begin by exploring how humans and computers encode data differently. Philosophers have long debated whether there is a reality beyond sensory data. How do we know what we know, and do we need data, whether sensory or numeric, for knowledge? Next we compare how humans encode data--using perception and memory--to how computers encode data. In both cases there is \"loss,\" but the reasons are different. With computers, we can understand how information is stored--using compression--by recourse to information theory and entropy (watch out! Information entropy is subtlety different from the entropy you may already be familiar with from physics). There is another key idea this week--the possibility that information, rather than matter, may form the basis of all reality. While we tend to think of \"data\" as inert, however, information is not.

This week, we look at algorithms and how we can process that data. We begin by exploring the long history of attempts to describe, systematize and automate cognition. The origins of computer science can be said to date back to Aristotle, and the field has been heavily influenced by math, logic and linguistics. You may also be surprised to learn how influential philosophers have been to the field. Once again we'll compare human information processing with computers. Can algorithms and AI help us understand how we think and even, perhaps, the nature of consciousness? As the best example of self-aware and intelligent matter in the Universe, the human mind is the natural yardstick for all other computational, cognitive and conscious systems. In terms of code, we'll learn how Computer Science represents and implements one familiar aspect of cognition: explicit algorithmic thinking. One of the best ways to learn how to code is to begin with \"pseudo-code\"--crafting an algorithm using informal language before we express it in a programming language like Python. We'll also study specific popular algorithms for common tasks (e.g. sort and search) as well as general patterns of computation (e.g. iteration and recursion). We close the week by focusing on the one aspect of human cognition that is still a mystery: consciousness. Can consciousness be explained mathematically, materially, or spiritually? While theories of consciousness used to be the domain of religion and philosophy, we now have physicists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists joining the debate. Is consciousness a fundamental property of the universe like information, matter and energy? A material process of our biology? A mathematical formula? A way of integrating information? Our conclusion has implications for whether we will be able to replicate consciousness in our machines. Of course, the larger question is undoubtedly: should we even try? In DataCamp, we finish the course (units 2, 3, and 4) Introduction to Data Science with Python. While this course would fit better with next week's focus on output and visualization, we have found it a gentle introduction to programming.

In a future week, you'll work with a no-code visualization tool called Tableau. This week, we start with the basics: the beauty of information visualized well as well as the pitfalls of poor visualizations. Also at stake are questions of what is left out--not because the visualization is bad, but because the data itself is limited or biased. Good visualizations can be incredibly persuasive, but so can visualizations that fudge the data to persuade you, or that camouflage missing or biased data. In addition to learning good design properties of data visualization, we'll take a crash course in how to spot bad data visualizations that can deceive. We'll also consider what may be \"invisible\" due to the way data is collected or organized, with a case study of data on women. We end the week with a consideration of how we now get much of our data news. Today, it's commonplace to find visualizations embedded in news stories, and data journalism appears almost indistinguishable from journalism. Is the rise of data journalism as well as so many niche news providers a sign of a healthy democracy? Or is the crisis of journalism, and in particular the waning of traditional news outlets and local news, a sign that we're heading into a world in which most people consume inaccurate news from their social media feed? As just one further point to consider for Friday's conversation, Noam Chomsky often claimed that even mainstream news was a propaganda machine, as is the educational system. You'll watch an interview from 1996 in which he details this viewpoint. What, if any thing, has changed since that interview, and for better or worse? DataCamp this week is a 2 hour no-code course, Data Visualization for Everyone, which will reinforce the principals of data visualization. We will spiral back to information presented in this week's DataCamp, so you don't have to absorb it all in the first go. The \"Test Your Understanding\" sections will identify key concepts. In class, we'll continue to explore datasets introduced last week in class, this week with an eye to finding a story in the data through visualizations. On Friday we finally begin our Introduction to Python course with unit 1, Python Basics. We also do a quick intro to DataCamp projects that should seem easy, since you've already been introduced to Jupyter notebooks!

Friday: Data Journalism and Media Noam Chomsky on Propaganda (30:00) The Big Idea, BBC, Feb 1996 As you read the Snowden interview below, look up people and events you're not familiar with. We will discuss Snowden's revelations about government surveillance in a future week. This week, focus on his arguments about what is/is not covered by journalists and why. Follow links to the James Rosen case, the AP case, and the Drone reporting (we will discuss drones in a future week; here consider whether journalism has a right/duty to report on this type of information, and consider how few outlets convey this type of news).

In a future week, you'll work with a no-code visualization tool called Tableau. This week, we start with the basics: the beauty of information visualized well as well as the pitfalls of poor visualizations. Also at stake are questions of what is left out--not because the visualization is bad, but because the data itself is limited or biased. Good visualizations can be incredibly persuasive, but so can visualizations that fudge the data to persuade you, or that camouflage missing or biased data. In addition to learning good design properties of data visualization, we'll take a crash course in how to spot bad data visualizations that can deceive. We'll also consider what may be \"invisible\" due to the way data is collected or organized, with a case study of data on women. We end the week with a consideration of how we now get much of our data news. Today, it's commonplace to find visualizations embedded in news stories, and data journalism appears almost indistinguishable from journalism. Is the rise of data journalism as well as so many niche news providers a sign of a healthy democracy? Or is the crisis of journalism, and in particular the waning of traditional news outlets and local news, a sign that we're heading into a world in which most people consume inaccurate news from their social media feed?

This week, we focus on how this single physical computer (a complete computational unit) can operate as just one \u201cnode\u201d in a much larger and more complex network of computers. Networking enables a single computational node to overcome limits of compute power, memory, and bandwidth by becoming part of a much larger network. When data and computation can be distributed over many individual computing units each node can perform certain sub/tasks as part of a much larger computational process. Scaling-up from individual computers to networks allows for changes not just in quantity of computing but in quality. Network effects describe the emergent property of networks in which the whole network has entirely new and sometimes unexpected properties beyond just the simple sum of its parts. In later weeks we\u2019ll discuss social networks, which also have their own properties and which often take on emergent unique properties that are also more than the sum of their individual actors. There is also a vast and growing \u201cInternet of Things (IoT)\u201d connecting sensors in \u201cthings\u201d all over the world from fitbits to automobile GPS sensors to nuclear powerplants. Blockchain/Bitcoin also uses the power of networks to build new models of decentralized trust for the exchange of goods, services and digital currency. Networks bring a double-edged sword of opportunity and risk. On the one hand, networks offer a robustness that a single computer can\u2019t. If a computer or node is down, information or processes can be rerouted easily to avoid the compromised node. Similarly, networks can be architected and segmented to optimize processing power and create subdomains of protection and trust. However, the vast interconnected network also provides opportunities for hacking, spreading propaganda, stifling dissent or facilitating illegal transactions via the Darknet. We begin the week with a quick introduction to operating systems by working at the command line. We will also learn about how networks are created to try to prevent threats and unauthorized intrusions, as well as the ways viruses and malware can circumvent these. Our ethical concern revolves around both the concentrated power and potential abuse of network effects by both state and non-state actors. First, we\u2019ll consider cyber warfare and discuss whether current paradigms for \u201cjust warfare\u201d need to be updated to accommodate our new reality.

Borrowing from cognitive science and the philosophy of language, we'll see important ways language and thought influence and shape each other. In earlier weeks we've considered the ways our access to and interpretation of information/data can affect how we describe a problem and how we solve it. This week we'll see how artificial and natural languages can constrain how we describe and even think about reality. We'll also compare different theories of how natural languages work. Theories of language, like theories of consciousness and information processing, have implications for whether AI can fully understand and employ human language. Monday we'll explore the parallels between natural language (English) and artificial language (Python) in terms of grammar rule, parsing and interpretation (how natural languages are 'fuzzy'). This also helps guide researchers along the most promising paths. On Wednesday you'll learn four major programming paradigms to discover how each \"thinks\" and \"describes\" a problem differently. Then we'll explore more deeply object-oriented programming (OOP) and its philosophical counterpart, object-oriented ontology (OOO). In Friday's class we'll focus on the big questions: How has Computation/AI changed the way we understand language, how we philosophically conceptualize our world, and how we theorize our cultural productions? In datacamp, you'll continue with Intermediate Python both this week and next. Many of the units spiral back to concepts already introduced, from Matplotlib to slicing. You will also employ the various kinds of logic and loops we first encountered in pseudocode. Monday: Thinking in Artificial and Natural Languages (some aspects of thought are independent of language) How to think like a Programmer (ONLY up to 41:00) CodingTech, Oct 2018 Linguistics as a Window to Understand the Brain (ONLY up to 13:39, Words) Steven Pinker, Think Big, Oct 2012 Noam Chomsky on Language Acquisition (1:47) BBC4, Jan 2015 What is the Python Interpreter? (How Does Python Work?) (14:00) Afternerd, Aug 2020 Datacamp Intermediate Python, Unit 1 of 5 (i.e. about 3/4 hour) Matplotlib Test Your Understanding The first three videos distinguish between thinking and the translation of the thought process into language, whether artificial or natural. How is this thought process the same or different for natural and artificial languages? Pinker also notes the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and linguistic relativity, which you should be familiar with. The programming language you are learning, Python, needs to be interpreted for the computer. On the most basic level, how does this work? Datacamp: This unit reviews concepts already learned in earlier datacamps and offers a deeper dive into the visualization and interpretation of data. Wednesday: Programming Paradigms/ Differences in Languages (languages and programming paradigms also shape the way we think) Pong and Object-Oriented Programming (12:30) Computerphile, Mar 2016 Four Programming Paradigms in 40 Minutes (41:00) Coding Tech, Mar 2018 (RF = Thursday/Friday) CARTA: Building Complex Knowledge with Language and Imagination (20:00) Lera Boroditsky, CARTA, Jul 2018 Datacamp Intermediate Python, Unit 2 of 5, Dictionaries and Pandas Test Your Understanding What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and what problems does it solve? If you are new to programming just try to follow along and understand the basic 4 categories of programming languages. We'll discuss more in class. How do languages shape the way we think and even what we can imagine? What functionality do dictionaries offer over lists? Also a new way to select data from a DataFrame: iloc and loc; we'll practice in class! Friday: How does AI/Computation Challenge our Theories of Language, of Philosophical Positions, and of Cultural Production? The first two readings (Pinker and SlateStarCodex) are simply to give you contrasting views of language as either complex psycho-social phenomena or simply large-scale statistical correlations.

Borrowing from cognitive science and the philosophy of language, we'll see important ways language and thought influence and shape each other. In earlier weeks we've considered the ways our access to and interpretation of information/data can affect how we describe a problem and how we solve it. This week we'll see how artificial and natural languages can constrain how we describe and even think about reality. We'll also compare different theories of how natural languages work. Theories of language, like theories of consciousness and information processing, have implications for whether AI can fully understand and employ human language. Monday we'll explore the parallels between natural language (English) and artificial language (Python) in terms of grammar rule, parsing and interpretation (how natural languages are 'fuzzy'). This also helps guide researchers along the most promising paths. On Wednesday you'll learn four major programming paradigms to discover how each \"thinks\" and \"describes\" a problem differently. Then we'll explore more deeply object-oriented programming (OOP) and its philosophical counterpart, object-oriented ontology (OOO). In Friday's class we'll focus on the big questions: How has Computation/AI changed the way we understand language, how we philosophically conceptualize our world, and how we theorize our cultural productions? In datacamp, you'll continue with Intermediate Python both this week and next. Many of the units spiral back to concepts already introduced, from Matplotlib to slicing. You will also employ the various kinds of logic and loops we first encountered in pseudocode. Monday: Thinking in Artificial and Natural Languages (some aspects of thought are independent of language) How to think like a Programmer (ONLY up to 41:00) CodingTech, Oct 2018 Linguistics as a Window to Understand the Brain (ONLY up to 13:39, Words) Steven Pinker, Think Big, Oct 2012 Noam Chomsky on Language Acquisition (1:47) BBC4, Jan 2015 What is the Python Interpreter? (How Does Python Work?) (14:00) Afternerd, Aug 2020 Datacamp Intermediate Python, Unit 1 of 5 (i.e. about 3/4 hour) Matplotlib Test Your Understanding The first three videos distinguish between thinking and the translation of the thought process into language, whether artificial or natural. How is this thought process the same or different for natural and artificial languages? Pinker also notes the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and linguistic relativity, which you should be familiar with. The programming language you are learning, Python, needs to be interpreted for the computer. On the most basic level, how does this work? Datacamp: This unit reviews concepts already learned in earlier datacamps and offers a deeper dive into the visualization and interpretation of data. Wednesday: Programming Paradigms/ Differences in Languages (languages and programming paradigms also shape the way we think) Pong and Object-Oriented Programming (12:30) Computerphile, Mar 2016 Four Programming Paradigms in 40 Minutes (41:00) Coding Tech, Mar 2018 (RF = Thursday/Friday) CARTA: Building Complex Knowledge with Language and Imagination (20:00) Lera Boroditsky, CARTA, Jul 2018 Datacamp Intermediate Python, Unit 2 of 5, Dictionaries and Pandas Test Your Understanding What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and what problems does it solve? If you are new to programming just try to follow along and understand the basic 4 categories of programming languages. We'll discuss more in class. How do languages shape the way we think and even what we can imagine? What functionality do dictionaries offer over lists? Also a new way to select data from a DataFrame: iloc and loc; we'll practice in class! Friday: How does AI/Computation Challenge our Theories of Language, of Philosophical Positions, and of Cultural Production? The first two readings (Pinker and SlateStarCodex) are simply to give you contrasting views of language as either complex psycho-social phenomena or simply large-scale statistical correlations.
